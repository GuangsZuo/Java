   What I have learned:
  1.  At first ,it is a coding-hidden mechanism.
  2.  It has access to the outer class's member , even private member.
    an inner class, an object of that inner class has a link to the enclosing object that made it, and 
    so it can access the members of that enclosing objectâ€”without any special qualifications. In 
    addition, inner classes have access rights to all the elements in the enclosing class.
  3.  In outer class,you can use it just like other ordinary classes. 
    But if you want to make an object of the inner class anywhere except from within a non-static method of the outer class, 
    you must specify the type of that object as OuterClassName.InnerClassName
